# Message-Repeater
A simple .vbs program I wrote to send repeating messages.

## Installation
This program is very easy to install. Simply clone the repo.

## Running the program
* Simply run the following file: ```./code/main.vbs```
* You will then be prompted with how many times you would like the message to be sent.
* After entering this information, you will be asked for the message contents.
* You will then be asked for the speed of each message sent in milliseconds.
* After a final prompt the program will run. Make sure you select the window you want the messages to be sent in before pressing "ok"
